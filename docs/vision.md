# GreekVote Long Term Plan
The long term vision for GreekVote

## Stages
### Stage 0 âœ…
This stage enables PSE DE to run a single recruitment cycle. This includes the core functionality of the platform, as listed below.

admin can: 
* upload PNMs
* open, close, and download traditional voting rounds
* open, close, and download did not interact rounds
* open, close, and download deliberation rounds
* upload PNM attendance at events
* view and download brother attendance
* hide and reveal PNM voting results
* manage users that have access to GreekVote

brothers can:
* vote
* post and view comments
* view all PNMs & sort / filter

### Stage 1
This stage enables the core functionality to be extended to multiple recruitment cycles. This still only applies to a single business fraternity, which in this case is PSE DE. This includes the following features:
* ability to start recruitment cycle
* ability to end/archive recruitment cycle
* ability to view archived recruitment cycles
* this shouldn't be super easy. it should be "difficult" to create a new recruitment cycle. what i mean by this is it shouldn't just be one button and bam a whole new database is spun up and new recruitment cycle created. new recruitment cycles will usually be created once per semester, per business fraternity.
* new recruitment cycles i think should have a blank slate of users that can access it. brothers from previous recruitment cycles will need to request to join the new one. this is to prevent people that have graduated or people from the past to get approval from admin before they can view the recruitment cycle.

### Stage 2
This stage extends the core functionality and multiple recruitment cycles to now be open to ANY fraternity/organization. Thoughts on this below:
* the way i initially envisioned this is: initial onboarding for a organzation would involved a leader creating the org on GreekVote. once the org is set up they can then create recruitment cycles. these would be like fall 2025, spring 2026, etc. 
    * i think the way this is done is the organization entity should have settings, to allow the ability to add and remove administrators. regular brohters (members) don't need access to the organization level of things. adminsitrators however, is how we prevent the org from going stale and creds being lost as students graduate and things are passed down.
* this stage should also be pretty hands off from my side of things. a new organization should be able to signup directly on the website, select a subsrction and pay, and straight up have access to their platform.
